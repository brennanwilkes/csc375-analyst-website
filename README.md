#### Development

To install dependencies, use:

```
npm install
```

To launch a live-updating development server on `localhost:3000` hosting the page, use:

```
npm start
```

To test if the project can build successfully for deployment, use:

```
npm run build
```


#### Deployment

To deploy, simply push to the `main` branch. This will trigger the build and deploy GitHub action and will automatically build the webapp and deploy it to GitHub pages. The built site can be viewed at: [brennanwilkes.github.io/csc375-client-website/](https://brennanwilkes.github.io/csc375-client-website/)
